        <p>It's wired to have <code>ghc</code> without <code>cabal-install</code>. What should I do if I want to install some hackage like <code>wreq</code>?</p>
        <p>EDIT: our admin Eric just installed <code>cabal-install</code>. It still has a memory issue with I run <code>cabal update</code>, but I think we will have <code>cabal</code> soon.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>Too many pages to read. I can't read as fast as a native English user. What if I can? Maybe I will become a better programmer, and learn more about the culture. But I can't. I can just  read as much as I can.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>CSS sucks. I have to trace the stucture of my web app, so I can create BEM-like class names dynamically. With the power of SASS <code>@import</code>, I can generate CSS with those names statically. I still hope someday I can use <a target="_blank" href="https://speakerdeck.com/vjeux/react-css-in-js">CSS in JS</a> in my company. I don't want to maintain two dependancies at all.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>Just make a strange promise that I will make my own tildeverse for friends after I leave my current job.</p>
        <p>Paul Ford's words in <a target="_blank" href="http://toe.prx.org/2014/11/backspace-to-the-future-the-dislike-club-part-i/">the dislike club part I</a> tells me that when the web becomes bigger enough to cover our life, we lost a place to escape from the rest of the world.</p>
        <p>lunadance and I did something similar in the 2003. We write secret diary in the BBS or the personal website. I think here in Taiwan we have not lost this kind of personal place right now. We can still open personal board in the BBS, and PTT - the biggest BBS here - is still improving <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ptt/pttbbs">it's system</a>.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>Yes, I <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/c9s/status/597422011409825793">miss her</a> too.</p>

      <h2>Who am I?</h2>
      <section>
        <p>I learned the tildeverse from <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/Ellaeon">@Ellaeon</a>'s tweet. He mentioned Paul Ford's <a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/message/tilde-club-i-had-a-couple-drinks-and-woke-up-with-1-000-nerds-a8904f0a2ebf">I had a couple drinks and woke up with 1,000 nerds - The story of Tilde.Club</a>.</p>
        <p>Then I found the <a target="_blank" href="/">ctrl-c.club</a>. I have to thank the admin for building these little town. So I can set a part of myself back to the 90s and be naive again.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>I am a web developer in Taiwan.</p>
        <p>When I was a boy, I read the Chinese version of <a target="_blank" href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780937175729.do">Practical UNIX Security</a> without accessing to anykind of *nix. I am also touched by stories of people in computer industry. So I must be a citizen of the tildeverse.</p>

      <h2>Important People in My Career</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="#">lunadance</a>
          <p>The friend who showed me the world of geeks.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a target="_blank" href="http://www.godfat.org/">godfat</a>
          <p>The friend who showed me the power of functional languages.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="#">otori-tan</a>
          <p>The one who saved me from struggling in finding sh*tty jobs in my hometown and showed me the power of connections of the Web. She is one of the earliest digital natives in my generation. She learned and mastered many things from the Internet, and created so many feedbacks to the global community.</p>
          <p>I don't know how to thank her properly. Saying something like "I wll give my life to the things you admired" isn't a mature option. So I must travel away to many uncharted lands and wish I can bring something to the community and her.</p>
        </li>

        Neo: I told you, Kid, you found me, I didn't find you.
        <br />Kid: I know, but you got me out! You saved me!
        <br />Neo: You saved yourself.
