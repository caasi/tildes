        <h3>05/20/15</h3>
        <p>A friend of mine told me how he got this job yesterday. The power of local open source community helps him become a contributor, the passion in table game helps him meet more people, and the RoR helps him become a better person.</p>
        <p>Then I realized that the number of projects one did doesn't matter. One's mental health is more important. Because it's not a job. It's the life itself.</p>
        <hr />
        <p><a target="_blank" href="/~philips">~philips</a> has some great ideas. One of them can start as a story, a blog post. Give me more time. I have to think about it.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>One of the great hacker in my country, c9s, is working on a compatible compiler for SASS called <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/c9s/c6">c6</a>. He got some warnings from the original authors even before he finished the project. They said it's not appropriate to call one's project 'compatible' if one wants to implement more features than the original project.</p>

        <p>I wake up. And I lost the feeling in the last night. I can't feel your emotions. I have many irrational fears. This is not a good sign. It's not healthy.</p>

        <h3>05/17/15</h3>
        <p>Typing down my thoughts here is not communication. It's the illusion of transparency. But how can I communicate with you without any commits?</p>
        <hr />
        <p>Then I spoke myself out. I asked many questions about the cyber "space", <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/A_Pattern_Language">"A Pattren Language"</a>, and the foundation of software. You answered my questions kindly. I see no exit here, but I think it's good for me to keep searching.</p>
        <p>I should publish those questions as an open letter, so your answers will be searchable for the rest of the world.</p>

        <p>I still don't consider myself a programmer, because I have never fight in any kind of contests like ACM-ICPC. There are many tiny worlds in this small world. I am not a part of any of them. And I can still code.</p>

        <p>Today I learned: <a target="_blank" hraf="http://www.geekcode.com/geek.html">GeekCode</a>. Add my own GeekCode to the about section. I have heard about Babylon 5, but I nerver watch a episode, so it's a 5? in my GeekCode.</p>

        <p>I am sorry that I am such a boring developer. I make a lot of meaningless noises. And I can not even finish a simple site in time.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>The API server and other important sites of my company are down for about 4 hours since 0011 GMT+8. Nobody has noticed that. If I want to work tonight, I have to mock every APIs I used.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>I had a Ubuntu server once. And I ran the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/linpc/maplebbs-itoc-tree">MapleBBS</a> on it. I opened some accounts so my friends can login and program on it. But I don't really understand the spirit of system administration then.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>It's not realistic to mock the API server before 0800 GMT+8. I gonna sleep.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>Today <a target="_blank" href="/~philips">~philips</a> told me more stories about how he learn to program. Looks like I meet another digital native. It reminds me of her. Maybe one can free his/her potential only by learning freely.</p>
        <p>Is it already too late to take back a life like that?</p>
        <hr />
        <p>Hi, <a target="_blank" href="/~godfat">~godfat</a>. Nice to meet you here. :)</p>

        <p><a target="_blank" href="/~philips/">~philips</a> is working on a blog template system called <code>bake</code>. He works on bioinformatics problem sets. He also codes in Rust. <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.rust-lang.org/2015/02/13/Final-1.0-timeline.html">Rust 1.0 will be released in May 15</a>. Friends at #cschat.tw are also exciting about it.</p>

        <p>Mr. Budd - our admin - has just solve the memory issue of <code>cabal update</code>! I can use <code>wreq</code> now.</p>
        <p>Back to the work, I have to finish the whole site and test every features this week. Should I use some REAL testing tools? I don't think I am fast enough to add something like <a target="_blank" href="https://facebook.github.io/jest/">Jest</a> in time.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>Somehow I feel happier when I put some part of myself back to the 90s and early 2000.</p>
        <p>Today I found two old sites. The first is about Win32 x86 ASM in Chinese: <a target="_blank" href="http://wanker742126.myweb.hinet.net/">小木偶的網頁</a>. The second is an open source epaper(also in Chinese) which is published between 2000 and 2001. It is called <a target="_blank" href="http://enews.tacocity.com.tw/browser.phtml?enews=csiuser">OpenScope 開放視界</a>.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>Just realize that I watch a lot of <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America%27s_Funniest_Home_Videos">AFHV</a> in the 90s. It's amazing that the show is still going in the 2015.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>Looks like I can update the timestamp of a symbol link by <a target="_blank" href="http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/63876/changing-the-timestamp-of-a-symlink">using touch</a>.</p>

        <p>It's wired to have <code>ghc</code> without <code>cabal-install</code>. What should I do if I want to install some hackage like <code>wreq</code>?</p>
        <p>EDIT: our admin Eric just installed <code>cabal-install</code>. It still has a memory issue with I run <code>cabal update</code>, but I think we will have <code>cabal</code> soon.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>Too many pages to read. I can't read as fast as a native English user. What if I can? Maybe I will become a better programmer, and learn more about the culture. But I can't. I can just  read as much as I can.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>CSS sucks. I have to trace the stucture of my web app, so I can create BEM-like class names dynamically. With the power of SASS <code>@import</code>, I can generate CSS with those names statically. I still hope someday I can use <a target="_blank" href="https://speakerdeck.com/vjeux/react-css-in-js">CSS in JS</a> in my company. I don't want to maintain two dependancies at all.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>Just make a strange promise that I will make my own tildeverse for friends after I leave my current job.</p>
        <p>Paul Ford's words in <a target="_blank" href="http://toe.prx.org/2014/11/backspace-to-the-future-the-dislike-club-part-i/">the dislike club part I</a> tells me that when the web becomes bigger enough to cover our life, we lost a place to escape from the rest of the world.</p>
        <p>lunadance and I did something similar in the 2003. We write secret diary in the BBS or the personal website. I think here in Taiwan we have not lost this kind of personal place right now. We can still open personal board in the BBS, and PTT - the biggest BBS here - is still improving <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ptt/pttbbs">it's system</a>.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>Yes, I <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/c9s/status/597422011409825793">miss her</a> too.</p>

        <p>I learned the tildeverse from <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/Ellaeon">@Ellaeon</a>'s tweet. He mentioned Paul Ford's <a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/message/tilde-club-i-had-a-couple-drinks-and-woke-up-with-1-000-nerds-a8904f0a2ebf">I had a couple drinks and woke up with 1,000 nerds - The story of Tilde.Club</a>.</p>
        <p>Then I found the <a target="_blank" href="/">ctrl-c.club</a>. I have to thank the admin for building these little town. So I can set a part of myself back to the 90s and be naive again.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>I am a web developer in Taiwan.</p>
        <p>When I was a boy, I read the Chinese version of <a target="_blank" href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780937175729.do">Practical UNIX Security</a> without accessing to anykind of *nix. I am also touched by stories of people in computer industry. So I must be a citizen of the tildeverse.</p>

          <p>The friend who showed me the world of geeks.</p>

        <li>
          <a href="#">otori-tan</a>
          <p>The one who saved me from struggling in finding sh*tty jobs in my hometown and showed me the power of connections of the Web. She is one of the earliest digital natives in my generation. She learned and mastered many things from the Internet, and created so many feedbacks to the global community.</p>
          <p>I don't know how to thank her properly. Saying something like "I wll give my life to the things you admired" isn't a mature option. So I must travel away to many uncharted lands and wish I can bring something to the community and her.</p>
