        <p>Hi, caasi in 1/14. How's your plan? The next Workshop is in 1/28; right before the Lunar New Year. I am you from 2/28, and I will tell you something like: You'll been to ShangHei. You will feel uncomfortable, but you know you have to understand China. You will read her code when you visiting the SJTU. You read like a boss, but you still don't get it.</p>
        <p>The most important thing is that I'll tell you something about Haskell! So you may be happier on the lonesome road.</p>
        <hr/>
        <pre><code>main = rhs</code></pre>
        <p>will become</p>
        <pre><code>PatBind l
  (PVar l (Ident l "main"))
  rhs
  Nothing</code></pre>
        <p><code>l</code> are the source locations. You can clean it up by using the <code>forgetL</code> fuction. the P in the <code>PVar</code> means "pattern". <code>Nothing</code> is for <code>where</code> bindings, and in this case there aren't any.</p>
        <hr/>
        <pre><code>case Just (Just (Pair 3 5)) of</code></pre>
        <p>will be</p>
        <pre><code>Case l
  (App l
    (Con l (UnQual l (Ident l "Just")))
    (Paren l
      (App l
        (Con l (UnQual l (Ident l "Just")))
        (Paren l
          (App l
            (App l
              (Con l (UnQual l (Ident l "Pair")))
              (Lit l (Int l 3 "3"))
            )
            (Lit l (Int l 5 "5"))
          )
        )
      )
    )
  )</code></pre>
        <p>It is followed by some <code>[Alt l]</code>.</p>
        <pre><code>_ | False -&gt; exp</pre></code>
        <p>will be</p>
        <pre><code>Alt l
  (PWildCard l)
  (GuardedRhss l
    [ GuardedRhs l
        [ Qualifier l (Con l (UnQual l (Ident l "False")))
        ]
        exp
    ]
  )
  Nothing</pre></code>
        <p>There are two kinds of constructors for <code>Rhs</code> type: <code>UnGuardedRhs</code> and <code>GuardedRhss</code>. The former has one <code>exp</code> in it. And the later has much <code>GuardedRhs</code>; they are looked like <code>| stmts = exp</code> or <code>| stmts -&gt; exp</code>.</p>
        <hr/>
        <code><pre>| Nothing -&gt; exp</pre></code>
        <p>will be</p>
        <code><pre>Alt l
  (PApp l (UnQual l (Ident l "Nothing")) [])
  (UnGuardedRhs l exp)
  Nothing</pre></code>
        <p>The data constructor <code>Nothing</code> is wrapped by a <code>PApp</code>, and it has no parameter.</p>
        <hr/>
        <code><pre>a | False -&gt; exp0
  | True  -&gt; exp1</pre></code>
        <p>will be</p>
        <code><pre>Alt l
  (PVar l (Ident "a"))
  (GuardedRhss l
    [ GuardedRhs l
        [ Qualifier l (Con l (UnQual l (Ident l "False")))
        ]
        exp0
    , GuardedRhs l
        [ Qualifier l (Con l (UnQual l (Ident l "True")))
        ]
        exp1
    ]
  )
  Nothing</pre></code>
        <p>One can see there are two <code>GuardedRhs</code> in <code>GuardedRhss</code> clearly.</p>
        <hr/>
        <p>Now you can understand <code>altToPartial</code>, <code>dataConToShape</code>, <code>buildReorder</code> and <code>orderedCaseToExp</code>. You need take your time to understand the AST. It's not that hard.</p>
        <hr/>
        <p>BTW, you will start to listen to songs composed by Deserts Xuan. You will noticed that the feeling you borrowed from the others is "losing". You still don't understand what you observed. Just like you will never understand yourself.</p>

        <p>I read mangas. Shounen mangas or shoujo mangas. I like to read stories about daily life. "Jijou", they said. Because I didn't have many when I was young. Now I have my own life. Should I stop peeking others?</p>

        <p>Hmmm.... It's been awhile.</p>
        <p>Finally I finished my first EC site. Without the power to make decisions, the site is just another gift exchange site. It makes no differences to the world. But it makes a little difference to my life. I don't think React is the best tech for the company right now. As an employee, I think I sholud learn some .Net. As a man with a lot of delusions in his head, I think I should quit the job.</p>
        <p>Just found out that I can give my care more easily if I ignore things like power or wealth. But I am not the one who doesn't have to care about those things. What should I do now? I have no place in this queue. Where is my queue? Do I really need a queue?</p>

        <p>Yesterday MnO2 gave a talk about <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVPMeHYWtos">Hindley Milner Type System(in Chinese)</a>. The talk introduces the basics of type inference. Then I found so unification libs like <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/bramstein/junify">junify</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/heya/unify">heya-unify</a> in JavaScript. @goatslacker also mentioned about unification in <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/gkz/LiveScript/issues/138">LiveScript's issue</a> before.</p>
        <p>Not sure if the destructuring is a simpler version of type inference or not.</p>

        <p>I found <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/1618">a quest</a> which is simple enough to understand and also complex enough to push me to know more about transpilers.</p>
        <p>And it leads to a simple answer:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>I am not a top notch programmer.</li>
          <li>There are nothing which can only be built by me.</li>
          <li>Transpilers are the most closest things to the spirit of <a target="_blank" href="https://extensiblewebmanifesto.org/">the Extensible Web Manifesto</a>.</li>
          <li>I can use, fix, and learn from babel, webpack and postcss directly.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Then why the hell should I work for anyone with unfulfillable promises?</p>

        <p><code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code> will be a problem if one can control one's response headers in many ways. In .NET land, you can <a target="_blank" href="http://enable-cors.org/server_aspnet.html">install ther CORS NuGet package</a>, or just <a target="_blank" href="http://enable-cors.org/server_iis6.html">inject it</a> in the IIS Manager.</p>
        <p>There is a note in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/#access-control-allow-origin-response-header">the W3C recommendation</a>:</p>
        <blockquote>In practice the origin-list-or-null production is more constrained. Rather than allowing a space-separated list of origins, it is either a single origin or the string "null".</blockquote>
        <p>It will be inconvenient if one can't modify the header programmatically. So if one want to enable CORS for one's subdomains, one have to <a target="_blank" href="http://tech.shift.com/post/65650561508/cors-with-wildcard-subdomains-using-nginx">write one's own function</a>.</p>

        <p>A friend of mine told me how he got this job yesterday. The power of local open source community helps him become a contributor, the passion in table game helps him meet more people, and the RoR helps him become a better person.</p>
        <p>Then I realized that the number of projects one did doesn't matter. One's mental health is more important. Because it's not a job. It's the life itself.</p>
        <hr />
        <p><a target="_blank" href="/~philips">~philips</a> has some great ideas. One of them can start as a story, a blog post. Give me more time. I have to think about it.</p>

        <p>One of the great hacker in my country, c9s, is working on a compatible compiler for SASS called <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/c9s/c6">c6</a>. He got some warnings from the original authors even before he finished the project.

You answered my questions kindly. I see no exit here, but I think it's good for me to keep searching.</p>

        <p>CSS sucks. I have to trace the stucture of my web app, so I can create BEM-like class names dynamically.

        <p>lunadance and I did something similar in the 2003. We write secret diary in the BBS or the personal website. I think here in Taiwan we have not lost this kind of personal place right now.

        <p>I learned the tildeverse from <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/Ellaeon">@Ellaeon</a>'s tweet. He mentioned Paul Ford's <a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/message/tilde-club-i-had-a-couple-drinks-and-woke-up-with-1-000-nerds-a8904f0a2ebf">I had a couple drinks and woke up with 1,000 nerds - The story of Tilde.Club</a>.</p>
        <p>Then I found the <a target="_blank" href="/">ctrl-c.club</a>. I have to thank the admin for building these little town. So I can set a part of myself back to the 90s and be naive again.</p>

        Quesitons are precious. It's a pity that if answers come easily.
        <br />I'd like to feel it in my mind, and exploring gently.
        <br />Then the process will be enjoyable.
